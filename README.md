# Customer-Sales-Behavior-Analysis

Hey there! 👋 This project is a Power BI dashboard I created to dive into customer behavior and sales performance in a retail setting. It’s packed with insights that help make sense of what’s selling, who’s buying, and how payments are made.

🔍 What’s Inside the Dashboard? Here’s a quick look at what the dashboard covers:

Key Metrics at a Glance:

🧾 Total Sales: 322.97K 📦 Quantity Sold: 6K 💰 Gross Income: 15.38K

Visuals that Tell a Story:

Product-wise sales and income breakdown Gender-wise quantity comparison across product lines Sales split by customer type (Member vs Normal) Payment trends – who’s paying how?

🎯 Why I Built This The goal was to better understand customer preferences and product performance through data. With this kind of dashboard, businesses can make smarter decisions – like which product line to promote or which customer segment to focus on.

💡 What I Found Interesting

Sales are almost evenly split between Members and Normal customers. Food and Beverages is the top performer in both total sales and income. Male customers show slightly higher engagement in most categories. Ewallets are the most preferred payment method – interesting trend!
